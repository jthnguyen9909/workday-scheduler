# Workday Scheduler

## Description

This is a workday scheduling application built from HTML, CSS, Javascript. This code utilizes the bootstrap framework for designing a stylish application as well as the Day.js utility to allow my application to interact with web data and information regarding the date and time. The application builds a webpage that displays the current date and creates a time block for every standard working hour of the day for users to type in information about each hour. The scheduler also allows users to save the information that they've written onto the page and view that information with a simple and comprehensive layout. 

## Usage

This application by using the Dayjs API dynamically updates the color scheme of each hour's description box by comparing the current time with the corresponding hour of each time block. The user can view and save their information by clicking on the save icon on the right of each time block, assuming that there is a value typed within that text area at the time. The date displayed in the header is also dynamically updated and will change to match the current date.
